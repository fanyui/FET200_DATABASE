SECOND YEAR PROGRAM

Requirement to use this system 
To run this programe you need any of the open source OS such as ubuntu mint,scientific
linux ,fedora 
If you are on windows the programe will still run provided you have code blocks
or dev-cpp install on your machine 

To run the programe in ubuntu

double click on the grades.exe file inside the open folder
and follow the instructions that comes up depending on whether you are a student or a lecturer

To run the programe on windows may require some skills frome you that is you have to double click on the grades.c 
and click run on the formating bar.
so I therefor recommend the use of any of the linux operating system to windows for now 

Using the program

This programe is written to help accomplish the problem of manually looking for 
grades of a student by both lecturers and students.the student is only allowed
to see his or her grade only and he or she most provide the matricule number the
school gave her
As for the lecturer he is able to manipulate the records of a student such as 
see all student with a particular grade in his first CA,second CA and all those who perform 
well in second CA than in first CA 
The other programe which accompany the grades.c is appendmat.c this is to add new 
students to the class list and also in case a particular student did not write a 
CA and the lecturer decided to give he or she a makeup test the lecturer can 
easily do that using the appendmat.c programe.
do not delete the appendmat.txt programe that comes as a packet with the other 
grades.c and appendmat.c for if you do the programe will not run again
